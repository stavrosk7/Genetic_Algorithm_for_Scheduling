## Information

That genetic algorithm obtains the [data](http://tracer.lcc.uma.es/problems/psp/generator.html) of the problem regarding the tasks and the employees of the project. In this process it groups the tasks through an evolutionary strategy. The outcome provides a solution with the corresponding cost and duration of the project tasks within their given constraints.

## Description 	

The Project Scheduling Problem (PSP) consists in deciding who does what during the software project lifetime. It is related to the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling (RCPS), an existing problem very popular in the literature. However, the problem defined here includes the concept of employee with salary and personal skills, also able of performing several tasks in a normal working day.

## Installation

Download to your project directory, add `README.md`, and commit:

```sh
curl -LO http://git.io/Xy0Chg
git add README.md
git commit -m "Use README Boilerplate"
```

## Usage

The source code in Matlab and compiled executables with an interactive interface are available at: 
```sh
[Git](https://github.com/skalaouzis/Genetic_Algorithm_for_Scheduling)
```

The command to execute the instance generator is: > java pfc.ingsw.ProblemGenerator <conﬁguration ﬁle> <output ﬁle> The instance generated can be invalid, that is, it can not be found a solution for it. The ﬁrst line of the output ﬁle is a comment line that indicates whether the instance is valid or not.

You can either make a local or a global installation. 
* Open the folder GeneticAlgorithmforScheduling 
* Edit the .cfg ﬁles in the folder GeneticAlgorithmforScheduling 
* Run GeneticAlgorithmforScheduling/main.m
